The base styles for the buttons are in the base-button directory. There, you can change the basic styles for the buttons.
You can add your own buttons and import BaseButton into the component file from components/base-button/base-button.component.jsx.
You can change the color and background color of the buttons as well as the box shadow.

# Pages

You can add pages by creating the page and importing and adding it to the fullpage component. 
There, you will find the fullpage settings. You can edit the content of the pages by going to the respective page's body component.
Eg. main-page-body.component.jsx. To edit the Title or Body styles, you can edit the respective Title and Body components in their directories.
